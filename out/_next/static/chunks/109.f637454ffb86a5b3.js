Currently, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of single-junction perovskite solar cells has exceeded 27%, demonstrating enormous application potential. However, its commercialization process is still limited by the inherent instability of the materials and their high sensitivity to external environmental stresses. Factors such as light, humidity, thermal stress, and mechanical fatigue often lead to device performance degradation, becoming major obstacles to its development. To address this, the self-healing strategy (Defect-Healing) has emerged as a cutting-edge solution, significantly extending device lifespan and improving its long-term reliability by actively repairing defects during operation.","page.news.20251028-zxc-afm.p5":"Against this backdrop, the team systematically summarized and deeply analyzed the degradation mechanisms and self-healing technologies of perovskite devices, revealing the basic mechanisms of defect repair and summarizing and comparing various typical self-healing methods, providing new ideas for achieving long-term stable operation of perovskite photovoltaic devices.","page.news.20251028-zxc-afm.p6":"02 Research Content and Highlights","page.news.20251028-zxc-afm.p7":"This dissertation delves into the self-healing mechanism and engineering implementation of perovskite systems from two perspectives: material degradation and defect repair.
